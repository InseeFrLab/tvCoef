\title{Computes RMSE of different models}
\usage{
rmse_prev(x, data, fixed_var = NULL, fixed_bw = FALSE, ...)

\method{rmse_prev}{formula}(x, data, fixed_var = NULL, fixed_bw = FALSE, ...)

\method{rmse_prev}{lm}(x, data, fixed_var = NULL, fixed_bw = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{formula} or \code{lm}, that is the description of the model to be fitted, or the model itself.}

\item{data}{a \code{ts} object containing the variables in the model. Necessary only when \code{x} is a formula.}

\item{fixed_var}{which variables of the model should have their coefficients fixed for the models with fixed coefficients. Obtained thanks to the hansen test.}

\item{fixed_bw}{\code{logical}, by default set to \code{FALSE}. Indicates if the bandwidth has to be computed again in the forecast model, or if it takes the value of the bandwidth of the \code{tvlm} model.}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{prev} which is a list containing the following elements:
\item{model}{a list of the 6 explanatory models}
\item{forecast}{a list of the 6 predictions of the 6 previous models}
\item{rmse}{a list of the 2 computed rmse, in sample and out of sample}
}
\description{
Computes 6 models: linear regression, piecewise regression (with linear regression and local regression), local regression (with \link{tvLM}), piecewise regression with some fixed coefficients and tvlm with fixed coefficients. Computes 6 rmse on their residuals and 6 others on the residuals of the predictions of these models.
}
\details{
In additional arguments, parameters as date and period can be informed. As in \link{oos_prev} they are by default respectively set to 28 and 1.

To estimate forecast models, the function \link{oos_prev} is used.

For the forecasts of the two models with fixed coefficients, fixed coefficients are re-estimated at each date, before \link{bp_lm} or \link{tvLM} are run on moving variables.
